## Basic 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Intro to C-sharp language

**Programming language**: A language that Humans use to communicate with machines. Without computer programs, we wouldn't have smartphones, websites, or even exploration in outer space.

- Summary
  - C# is a powerful OOP language developed by Micorsoft.
  - General Purpose: We can create mobile, web,desktop and game application.
  - we can built application on the Microsoft .NET platform.
  - Cross Platform Independent: Micorsoft .NET Core made sure C# is not more only for windows but for linux and MacOS well.
  - typed safe / statically typed language

C# (pronounced "C sharp") is a modern, object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft. It is designed for building a variety of applications on the Microsoft .NET platform. C# is widely used for developing desktop applications, web applications, mobile apps, cloud-based services, and game development.

Key features and aspects of C# include:

1. **Object-Oriented:** C# is an object-oriented programming (OOP) language, supporting concepts such as classes, objects, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

2. **Managed Code:** C# code is typically compiled into an intermediate language called Common Intermediate Language (CIL), and it runs on the Common Language Runtime (CLR), which provides features like memory management (garbage collection), exception handling, and security.

3. **Type-Safe:** C# is statically typed, which means that the type of a variable must be declared before it can be used. This helps catch type-related errors at compile time.

4. **Syntax:** C# syntax is influenced by languages like C, C++, and Java. If you are familiar with these languages, you'll find many similarities in C# syntax.

5. **Rich Standard Library:** C# comes with a comprehensive standard library, part of the .NET Framework or .NET Core, which provides functionality for tasks such as file I/O, networking, database access, and more.

6. **Integrated Development Environment (IDE):** Microsoft provides Visual Studio, a powerful IDE for C# development. Visual Studio offers features like code completion, debugging tools, and project management, making it a popular choice among C# developers.

7. **Cross-Platform Development:** With the introduction of .NET Core, C# is no longer limited to Windows development. .NET Core is a cross-platform, open-source framework that allows C# developers to build applications for Windows, Linux, and macOS.

8. **Language Features:** C# includes modern language features such as LINQ (Language-Integrated Query), async/await for asynchronous programming, properties, events, delegates, and more.

9. **Web Development:** C# is commonly used for web development, particularly in combination with ASP.NET, a framework for building web applications.

10. **Game Development:** C# is a primary language for game development using the Unity game engine. Unity enables developers to create games for various platforms, including desktop, mobile, and consoles.

C# continues to evolve with new features and improvements, and it remains a popular choice for developers building a wide range of applications in different domains.

### 1.2 Setting up the environment

- mac: install .NET Core using homebrew. `brew install --cask dotnet-sdk` and check the version `dotnet --version`
- install VSCode editior
- install c# extension

### 1.3 First C-sharp Program

- output: a message on screen/terminal. `Console.WriteLine("Welcome to C#!");`

  ```c#
  using System;

  public class Program
  {
      public static void Main(string[] args)
      {
          Console.Write("Welcome to the Code Playground");
          Console.WriteLine("Welcome to the Code Playground");
      }
  }
  ```

#### break down basic structure

- Namespaces / Class: helps to separate code. `using System;` allows you to use Console.WriteLine method and other methods. Namespaces are optional. Instead of System.Console.WriteLine use Console.WriteLine method by use System. Use . operator to access the class or namespace members.

- In C#, creating a class is mandatory for the program’s execution. Main method is the entry point or starting point of the program.

To run the first C# program in Visual Studio Code (VSCode), follow these steps:

#### Step 1: Install Required Software

1. **Install Visual Studio Code:**
   If you don't have Visual Studio Code installed, you can download and install it from the official website: [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

2. **Install .NET SDK:**
   Ensure you have the .NET SDK installed on your machine. You can follow the previous instructions to install it using Homebrew on macOS.

#### Step 2: Set Up a C# Project

1. **Create a Folder:**
   Open your terminal and create a new folder for your C# project:

   ```bash
   mkdir HelloWorld
   cd HelloWorld
   ```

2. **Initialize a C# Project:**
   Run the following command to initialize a new C# console application:

   ```bash
   dotnet new console
   ```

   This command creates a simple "Hello World" C# console application.

#### Step 3: Open Project in Visual Studio Code

1. **Open VSCode:**
   Open Visual Studio Code and navigate to the folder you created for your C# project:

   ```bash
   code .
   ```

   This command opens the current folder in VSCode.

#### Step 4: Run the Program

1. **Open Terminal in VSCode:**
   In VSCode, open a new terminal by clicking on "View" in the top menu and selecting "Terminal."

2. **Build and Run:**
   In the terminal, run the following commands to build and run your C# program:

   ```bash
   dotnet build
   dotnet run
   ```

   This will build and execute your C# program. You should see the "Hello World" output in the terminal.

Congratulations! You've successfully run your first C# program in Visual Studio Code. You can now start exploring and writing C# code in your VSCode environment.

#### Statements

- A statement (a line of code) performs a specific task. Each Statement ends with a semicolon.
- In case of multiple statements top to bottom is the apporach of executing statements.

```c#
public class Program{
  public static void Main(string[] args)
  {
    Console.WriteLine("My name is Anisul Islam.");
    Console.WriteLine(143);
  }
}
```

#### Assignment 1: Print your bio

```csharp
class Test
{
  public static void Main(string[] args)
  {
    Console.WriteLine("Name: Anisul Islam");
    Console.WriteLine("Age: 32");
    Console.WriteLine("Profession: Software developer");
  }
}
```

### 1.4 comments and escape sequences

- what is comment and why do you need comment?
      - to explain your code
      - to avoid running some part of your code for debugging
- single line comment -> `// this is a single line comment`
- multi-line comments -> `/*   */`
- escape sequences: \n, \t, \r, \\, \", \'

```csharp
   string fullName = "Aniul\nIslam\nRubel";
   Console.WriteLine(fullName);
```

- verbatim string: it allows linebreaks in strings. use @ symbol before double quotes.

```csharp
Console.WriteLine(@"Hello!
Welcome to the verbatim string");
```

### 1.5 Variables and data types

- variable declaration and initialization
- data type
      - string; example of string: "this is a string"
         - `string name; name="Anisul Islam";`
      - char; char bloodGroup = 'A'
      - int; int age = 32
      - double; double age = 95.4
      - float height = 1.82f;
      - decimal weight = 92.8m;
      - bool isRegistered = true;

- we can change the value of variable anywhere in the program

#### variable naming conventions

- descriptive
- meaningful
- camelCase
- avoid single letter naming (exception for loops)

#### Assignment 2: declare product data types and print variables

![assignment-2](images/assignment-2.png)

#### Constant variables and multiple variables

- constant variables: const string universityName = "Leading University";
- string concatenation: "anisul" + "islam"
- multiple variables: int x,y,z; x=y=z=50;

#### Type Casting - Implicit, Explicit

- Implicit (automatically - converting a smaller type to a larger type size): char -> int -> long -> float -> double
- Explicit (manually - converting a larger type to a smaller size type): double -> float -> long -> int -> char
- Type Conversion Methods: It is also possible to convert data types explicitly by using built-in methods, such as Convert.ToBoolean, Convert.ToDouble, Convert.ToString, Convert.ToInt32 (int) and Convert.ToInt64 (long)
- `System.Console.WriteLine($"{number2.GetType()}");`

### 1.6 User Input

- Console.ReadLine(), Convert.ToString(), Convert.ToBoolean(), Convert.ToInt16(),Convert.ToInt32(), Convert.ToInt64() and Convert.ToChar(), Convert.ToDouble()
- Error: not possible to convert a textual string like "welcome" to an int.

```c#
using System;
class Test
{
  public static void Main(string[] args)
  {
    string? studentName;
    int studentAge;
    double salary;

    Console.Write("Enter your name: ");
    studentName = Console.ReadLine();

    Console.Write("Enter your age: ");
    studentAge = Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine());

    Console.Write("Enter your monthly salary: ");
    salary = Convert.ToDouble(Console.ReadLine());


    Console.WriteLine("Name: " + studentName);
    Console.WriteLine("Age: " + studentAge + " years old");
    Console.WriteLine($"Welcome {name}. You are {age}. Your salary is ${salary:F2}");
  }
}
```

#### Assignment 3: take student input for gpa and isRegistered

### 1.7 Math operatoions & Precedence

### 1.8 Formatting output - String concatenation & interpolation

- we can use variable inside a string by using string interpolation!

```c sharp
    int number1 = 10;
    int number2 = 3;
    int result;
    double pi = 3.1416;

    result = number1 + number2;
    // Console.WriteLine($"{number1} + {number2} = {result}");
    Console.WriteLine("{0} + {1} = {2}", number1, number2, result);

   Console.WriteLine($"pi = {pi}");
   Console.WriteLine($"pi = {pi:F2}");

```

## Basic 2. Operators

C# supports various operators that allow you to perform operations on variables and values. Here's a list of some common operators in C#:

### Arithmetic Operators

1. **Addition (`+`):**

   ```csharp
   int result = a + b;
   ```

2. **Subtraction (`-`):**

   ```csharp
   int result = a - b;
   ```

3. **Multiplication (`*`):**

   ```csharp
   int result = a * b;
   ```

4. **Division (`/`):**

   ```csharp
   int result = a / b;
   ```

5. **Modulus (`%`):**

   ```csharp
   int result = a % b;
   ```

- some arithmetic operators programs

```csharp
// basic calculator
using System;
class Test
{
  public static void Main(string[] args)
  {
    int number1 = 10;
    int number2 = 3;
    int result;

    result = number1 + number2;
    // Console.WriteLine($"{number1} + {number2} = {result}");
    Console.WriteLine("{0} + {1} = {2}", number1, number2, result);

    result = number1 - number2;
    Console.WriteLine($"{number1} - {number2} = {result}");

    result = number1 * number2;
    Console.WriteLine($"{number1} * {number2} = {result}");


    double div = (double)number1 / number2;
    Console.WriteLine($"{number1} / {number2} = {div.ToString("F2")}");
    Console.WriteLine($"{number1} / {number2} = {div:F2}");


    result = number1 % number2;
    Console.WriteLine($"{number1} % {number2} = {result}");

  }
}

// area of triagle
using System;
class Test
{
  public static void Main(string[] args)
  {
    // triangle area = 0.5 * base * height
    double baseLength, height, triangleArea;

    Console.WriteLine("Triangle Area Calculator");

    Console.Write("Base = ");
    baseLength = Convert.ToDouble(Console.ReadLine());

    Console.Write("Height = ");
    height = Convert.ToDouble(Console.ReadLine());

    triangleArea = 0.5 * baseLength * height;
    Console.WriteLine($"Triangle Area = {triangleArea.ToString("F2")}");
  }
}


// temperature conversion (celsius to fahrenheit conversion)
using System;
class Test
{
  public static void Main(string[] args)
  {
    double fahrenheit, celsius;

    Console.Write("fahrenheit = ");
    fahrenheit = Convert.ToDouble(Console.ReadLine());

    celsius = (fahrenheit - 32) / 1.8;
    Console.WriteLine($"celsius = {celsius:F2} degrees");

  }
}

```

#### Assignment 4: sum and average of 3 numbers

```csharp

    Console.WriteLine($"average = {average.ToString("F2")}");

  }
}

```

##### Assignment 5: area of circle

```csharp
using System;
class Test
{
  public static void Main(string[] args)

    // circle area = 3.1416 * radius * radius
    double radius, circleArea;

    Console.WriteLine("Circle Area Calculator");

    Console.Write("radius = ");
    radius = Convert.ToDouble(Console.ReadLine());

    circleArea = Math.PI * radius * radius;
    Console.WriteLine($"Circle Area = {circleArea.ToString("F2")}");

    fahrenheit = (1.8 * celsius) + 32;
    Console.WriteLine($"fahrenheit = {fahrenheit:F2} degrees");

  }
}
```

### Assignment Operators

1. **Assignment (`=`):**

   ```csharp
   int a = 10;
   ```

2. **Add and assign (`+=`):**

   ```csharp
   a += 5;  // equivalent to a = a + 5;

   ```

```csharp
using System;
class Test

  public static void Main(string[] args)
  {
    int number = 20;

    number += 5; // number = number + 5
    Console.WriteLine($"{number}");

    number -= 5; // number = number - 5
    Console.WriteLine($"{number}");

    number *= 5; // number = number * 5
    Console.WriteLine($"{number}");

    number /= 5; // number = number / 5
    Console.WriteLine($"{number}");

    number %= 5; // number = number % 5
    Console.WriteLine($"{number}");

  }
}

```

### Relational Operators

1. **Equal to (`==`):**

   ```csharp
   if (a == b)
   ```

2. **Not equal to (`!=`):**

   ```csharp
   if (a != b)
   ```

3. **Greater than (`>`):**

   ```csharp
   if (a > b)
   ```

4. **Less than (`<`):**

   ```csharp
   if (a < b)
   ```

5. **Greater than or equal to (`>=`):**

   ```csharp
   if (a >= b)
   ```

6. **Less than or equal to (`<=`):**

   ```csharp
   if (a <= b)
   ```

### Logical Operators

1. **Logical AND (`&&`):**

   ```csharp
   if (condition1 && condition2)
   ```

2. **Logical OR (`||`):**

   ```csharp
   if (condition1 || condition2)
   ```

3. **Logical NOT (`!`):**

   ```csharp
   if (!condition)
   ```

### Bitwise Operators

In C#, bitwise operators perform operations at the bit level. These operators work with individual bits of integer types (`int`, `long`, `short`, `byte`, etc.). Here are the bitwise operators in C#:

1. **Bitwise AND (`&`):**
   - **Description:** Sets each bit to 1 if both bits are 1.
   - **Example:**

     ```csharp
     int result = 5 & 3;  // Binary: 101 & 011 = 001
     Console.WriteLine(result);  // Output: 1
     ```

2. **Bitwise OR (`|`):**
   - **Description:** Sets each bit to 1 if at least one of the corresponding bits is 1.
   - **Example:**

     ```csharp
     int result = 5 | 3;  // Binary: 101 | 011 = 111
     Console.WriteLine(result);  // Output: 7
     ```

3. **Bitwise XOR (`^`):**
   - **Description:** Sets each bit to 1 if only one of the corresponding bits is 1.
   - **Example:**

     ```csharp
     int result = 5 ^ 3;  // Binary: 101 ^ 011 = 110
     Console.WriteLine(result);  // Output: 6
     ```

4. **Bitwise NOT (`~`):**
   - **Description:** Inverts each bit.
   - **Example:**

     ```csharp
     int result = ~5;  // Binary: ~0101 = 1010
     Console.WriteLine(result);  // Output: -6
     ```

5. **Left Shift (`<<`):**
   - **Description:** Shifts the bits of a number to the left by a specified number of positions.
   - **Example:**

     ```csharp
     int result = 5 << 2;  // Binary: 101 << 2 = 10100
     Console.WriteLine(result);  // Output: 20
     ```

6. **Right Shift (`>>`):**
   - **Description:** Shifts the bits of a number to the right by a specified number of positions.
   - **Example:**

     ```csharp
     int result = 5 >> 1;  // Binary: 101 >> 1 = 10
     Console.WriteLine(result);  // Output: 2
     ```

Bitwise operators are commonly used in scenarios where individual bits represent flags or options, and you need to perform operations at a lower level than regular arithmetic operators.

### Increment and Decrement Operators

1. **Increment (`++`):**

   ```csharp
   a++;
   ```

2. **Decrement (`--`):**

   ```csharp
   a--;
   ```

### Conditional Operator (Ternary Operator)

```csharp
int result = (a > b) ? a : b;

// even/odd program
class Test
{
  public static void Main(string[] args)
  {
    Console.Write("Enter a number: ");
    int number = Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine());

    string result = number % 2 == 0 ? "Even" : "Odd";
    Console.WriteLine($"{number} is an {result} number");
    Console.Read();
  }
}
```

This is a concise way to express an `if-else` statement.

These are some of the basic operators in C#. Understanding how to use these operators is fundamental to writing effective C# code.

## Basic 3. Control Statement

### 3.1 Conditional control statement

Control statements in C# are used to control the flow of execution in a program. They allow you to make decisions, loop through code, and execute different blocks of code based on certain conditions. Here are some of the main control statements in C#:

1. **if Statement:**
   - The `if` statement is used for conditional branching. It executes a block of code if a specified condition is true.

     ```csharp
     if (condition)
     {
         // Code to be executed if the condition is true
     }
     ```

   - nested if

2. **else Statement:**
   - The `else` statement is used with `if` to execute a block of code if the `if` condition is false.

     ```csharp
     if (condition)
     {
         // Code to be executed if the condition is true
     }
     else
     {
         // Code to be executed if the condition is false
     }
     ```

3. **else if Statement:**
   - The `else if` statement is used to specify a new condition to test if the previous `if` or `else if` conditions are false.

     ```csharp
     if (condition1)
     {
         // Code to be executed if condition1 is true
     }
     else if (condition2)
     {
         // Code to be executed if condition2 is true
     }
     else
     {
         // Code to be executed if all conditions are false
     }
     ```

4. **switch Statement:**
   - 4 keywords to remember: switch, case, break and default. The `switch` statement is used to select one of many code blocks to be executed.

     ```csharp
     switch (variable)
     {
         case value1:
             // Code to be executed if variable equals value1
             break;
         case value2:
             // Code to be executed if variable equals value2
             break;
         // ... other cases ...
         default:
             // Code to be executed if none of the cases match
             break;
     }
     ```

#### program 1 positive, negative or zero

```csharp
   // program 1. positive, negative or zero
   using System;
   class Test
   {
   public static void Main(string[] args)
   {
      int number = 0;
      if (number > 0)
      {
         Console.WriteLine("Positive Number");
      }
      else if (number < 0)
      {
         Console.WriteLine("Negative Number");
      }
      else
      {
         Console.WriteLine("Zero");
      }
   }
   }
```

#### program 2: digit spelling program

```csharp
// program 2: digit spelling program
using System;
class Test
{
  public static void Main(string[] args)
  {
    // digit - 0-9
    // digit spelling program

    Console.Write("Enter any digit between 0 and 9: ");
    int digit = Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine());

    if (digit == 0)
    {
      Console.WriteLine("Zero");
    }
    else if (digit == 1)
    {
      Console.WriteLine("One");
    }
    else if (digit == 2)
    {
      Console.WriteLine("Two");
    }
    else if (digit == 3)
    {
      Console.WriteLine("Three");
    }
    else if (digit == 4)
    {
      Console.WriteLine("Four");
    }
    else if (digit == 5)
    {
      Console.WriteLine("Five");
    }
    else if (digit == 6)
    {
      Console.WriteLine("Six");
    }
    else if (digit == 7)
    {
      Console.WriteLine("Seven");
    }
    else if (digit == 8)
    {
      Console.WriteLine("Eight");
    }
    else if (digit == 9)
    {
      Console.WriteLine("Nine");
    }
    else
    {
      Console.WriteLine("Not a valid digit.");
    }
  }
}
```

#### Assignment 7: Even/Odd numbers

```csharp
using System;
class Test
{
  public static void Main(string[] args)
  {
    int number;
    Console.Write("Enter a number: ");
    number = Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine());

    if (number % 2 == 0)
    {
      Console.WriteLine($"{number} is Even");
    }
    else
    {
      Console.WriteLine($"{number} is Odd");
    }
  }
}


```

#### program 3: large number between 2 numbers

```csharp
using System;
class Test
{
  public static void Main(string[] args)
  {
    int number1, number2;

#### Assignment 9: Grade Calculator

```csharp

**Objective:** Create a simple program that calculates and displays the letter grade based on the percentage score entered by the user.

**Instructions:**

1. **Input:**
   - Prompt the user to enter their percentage score.
   - Validate the input to ensure it is a number between 0 and 100.

2. **Grade Calculation:**
   - Use if-else statements to determine the letter grade based on the following grading scale:
     - A: 90-100
     - B: 80-89
     - C: 70-79
     - D: 60-69
     - F: 0-59

3. **Output:**
   - Display the calculated letter grade to the user.

**Example Output:**
Enter your percentage score: 85
Your grade is: B


**Grading:**
- Correct calculation of letter grade: 70%
- Input validation: 20%
- Code structure, comments, and readability: 10%

**Additional Challenges:**
1. Allow the user to input their scores for multiple subjects and calculate the overall GPA.
2. Implement a switch statement instead of if-else for grade calculation.
3. Handle edge cases, such as negative scores or scores above 100, gracefully.

This assignment allows students to practice if-else statements, input validation, and basic program structure. They can also extend the functionality to make it more complex based on their skill level.

### 3.2 Loop control statement

1. **while Loop:**
   - The `while` loop is used to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as the specified condition is true.

     ```csharp
     while (condition)
     {
         // Code to be executed while the condition is true
     }
     ```

2. **do-while Loop:**
   - The `do-while` loop is similar to the `while` loop, but it ensures that the block of code is executed at least once.

     ```csharp
     do
     {
         // Code to be executed
     } while (condition);
     ```

3. **for Loop:**
   - The `for` loop is used to repeatedly execute a block of code a specific number of times.

     ```csharp
     for (initialization; condition; update)
     {
         // Code to be executed in each iteration
     }
     ```

4. **foreach Loop:**
   - The `foreach` loop is used to iterate over elements in a collection (e.g., arrays, lists).

     ```csharp
     foreach (var item in collection)
     {
         // Code to be executed for each item in the collection
     }
     ```

These control statements provide flexibility and help in creating more dynamic and responsive programs in C#.

## Basic 4. Methods / function

- use capital letter for Method Name
- what to learn?
      - how to define a function
      - how to call a function
      - how to pass parameters to a function
      - how to return from a function

- Method: A method is a block of code created inside a class that performs a specific task or operation. It is a fundamental building block in any programming language and is defined within a class or a struct. Methods are used to encapsulate logic, promote code reusability, and organize code into manageable units.

```csharp
// AccessModifier ReturnType MethodName(ParameterType parameter1, ParameterType parameter2, ...)
// {
//     // Method body
//     // Code to perform the task
//     // Optionally, return a value of ReturnType
// }

public class MyClass
{
    // Example method without parameters and return type
    public void SimpleMethod()
    {
        // Method body
        Console.WriteLine("Hello from SimpleMethod!");
    }

    // Example method with parameters and return type
    public int Add(int a, int b)
    {
        // Method body
        int sum = a + b;
        return sum;
    }
}
```

### Assignment 11: create a calculator using function

Certainly! Here's a simple project idea for practicing methods in C#: a basic calculator application.

**Calculator Project:**

**Requirements:**

1. Create a C# console application.
2. Define a `Calculator` class that contains methods for basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
3. Implement a menu-driven interface that allows the user to choose an operation and input operands.
4. Perform the selected operation and display the result.

**Code Example:**

```csharp
using System;

class Calculator
{
    public int Add(int a, int b)
    {
        return a + b;
    }

    public int Subtract(int a, int b)
    {
        return a - b;
    }

    public int Multiply(int a, int b)
    {
        return a * b;
    }

    public double Divide(int a, int b)
    {
        if (b != 0)
        {
            return (double)a / b;
        }
        else
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Error: Cannot divide by zero.");
            return double.NaN;
        }

This simple calculator project allows students to practice creating a class with methods to perform different operations, handle user input, and implement a menu-driven interface.

### Assignment 12: create an area calculator - triangle, rectangle

### Project 4 - Converter Project

Certainly! Here's a simple C# console application for a converter that converts between units. In this example, let's create a basic length converter:

```csharp
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        while (true)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Unit Converter");
            Console.WriteLine("1. Convert Inches to Centimeters");
            Console.WriteLine("2. Convert Centimeters to Inches");
            Console.WriteLine("3. Exit");

            Console.Write("Choose an operation (1-3): ");
            string choice = Console.ReadLine();

            if (int.TryParse(choice, out int operation) && operation >= 1 && operation <= 3)
            {
                if (operation == 3)
                {
                    Console.WriteLine("Exiting the unit converter. Goodbye!");
                    break;
                }

                switch (operation)
                {
                    case 1:
                        Console.Write("Enter length in inches: ");
                        if (double.TryParse(Console.ReadLine(), out double inches))
                        {
                            double centimeters = InchesToCentimeters(inches);
                            Console.WriteLine($"{inches} inches is equal to {centimeters} centimeters.");
                        }
                        else
                        {
                            Console.WriteLine("Invalid input for inches.");
                        }
                        break;
                    case 2:
                        Console.Write("Enter length in centimeters: ");
                        if (double.TryParse(Console.ReadLine(), out double centimeters))
                        {
                            double inches = CentimetersToInches(centimeters);
                            Console.WriteLine($"{centimeters} centimeters is equal to {inches} inches.");
                        }
                        else
                        {
                            Console.WriteLine("Invalid input for centimeters.");
                        }
                        break;
                }
            }
            else
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Invalid choice. Please enter a number between 1 and 3.");
            }

            Console.WriteLine();
        }
    }

    private static double InchesToCentimeters(double inches)
    {
        return inches * 2.54;
    }

    private static double CentimetersToInches(double centimeters)
    {
        return centimeters / 2.54;
    }
}
```

This simple converter allows users to convert lengths between inches and centimeters. Users can choose the desired conversion, enter the length, and get the converted result. Feel free to expand and modify the converter to include other units or functionalities based on your needs.

## Intermediate 1. OOP

### Classes and Objects

- class: A template from individual object is created. A class is a custom data type or blueprint. It defines the data and behavior for a type. We can have variables and methods in a class.

- object: An object is a instance of a class.

- by default all class member is private. we can use dot operator to assign value to a class member.

```csharp
class Student{
  public string name;
  public int age;
  public static DisplayInfo(){
    Console.WriteLine();
  }
}
class Test{
  public static void Main(string[] args){
    Student s1 = new Student();
    s1.name="Anisul";
  }
}

```

### Encapsulation

- encapsulation is the idea of "surrounding" an entity, not just to keep what's inside together, but also to protect it. hiding from outside using private.
- benefits of encapsulation
  - You can control access or modification of the data.
  - You can make the code more flexible and easy to change with new requirements.
  - Change one part of code without affecting other parts of code.
- Access modifiers: public, private, protected, internal, protected internal. The public access modifier makes the member accessible from the outside of the class. The private access modifier makes members accessible only from within the class and hides them from the outside.

```csharp
class Student
{
  private string fullName;
  private int age;

  public void SetFullName(string fName)
  {
    fullName = fName;
  }

  public string GetFullName()
  {
    return fullName;
  }
  public void SetAge(int age)
  {
    this.age = age;
  }

  public int GetAge()
  {
    return age;
  }
}

class Test
{
  public static void Main(string[] args)
  {
    Student s1 = new Student();
    s1.SetFullName("Anisul Islam");
    s1.SetAge(33);
    Console.WriteLine(s1.GetFullName());
    Console.WriteLine(s1.GetAge());
  }
}
```

### Constructor

- a special public method that has no return type and called automatically when the object is created.

### Properties

- encapsulate members and give access them with Property a public member that will have accessor (get and set accessors)

```csharp
class Student
{
  private string name; // field
  public string Name // property
  {
    set { name = value; }
    get { return name; }
  }
}

class Test
{
  public static void Main(string[] args)
  {
    Student s1 = new Student();
    s1.Name = "Anisul Islam";
    Console.WriteLine(s1.Name);
  }
}
```
